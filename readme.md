# RapidCare: AI-Powered Mass Casualty Incident Response System

## üö® The Challenge

In mass casualty events like concerts, wildfires, or emergency situations, the ability to respond swiftly and effectively can make all the difference in saving lives. Each year, countless individuals suffer injuries in these environments, highlighting the urgent need for fast, reliable, and coordinated care. Not to mention that during MCI, internet access might be interrupted. From rapidly assessing injuries to locating missing loved ones, the challenge is immense, and the demand for a seamless, real-time, offline-first response system has never been greater.

## üöë The Solution

Enter **RapidCare** ‚Äî a groundbreaking solution designed to transform emergency response during mass casualty events. Powered by the advanced Gemma 3n AI engine, RapidCare is a voice-activated, multi-role, on-device AI assistant tailored for field triage, coordination, and communication. Whether you're a paramedic, nurse, field agent, or a family member searching for a loved one, RapidCare equips you with the tools needed to act quickly and efficiently.

This cutting-edge app is designed to operate fully offline on mobile devices, including Google Edge AI, Jetson devices, and web browsers, ensuring optimal performance regardless of connectivity. With intelligent medical triage features like video-based assessments, real-time vitals transcription, and patient reunification capabilities, RapidCare serves as a vital assistant to those working on the frontlines and those desperately seeking information.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### **Key Technologies:**

#### **Progressive Web App (PWA)**
By leveraging the power of PWA, we ensure that RapidCare is accessible across Web, Android, and iOS platforms, with code written once for broad deployment.

#### **Offline Capabilities**
Through an HTTP Bridge, RapidCare can communicate with on-device AI for tasks like image analysis, enabling the app to function seamlessly without cloud dependence.

#### **On-Device AI Processing**
With Google Edge AI and Jetson devices, all critical tasks are processed locally, ensuring rapid and reliable responses even in the most chaotic environments. When there's no internet connectivity, data is first stored in Jetson device. When internet comes back, Jetson syncs the data in storage to the cloud.

## üéØ Impact

With RapidCare, emergency responders and families can navigate the chaos of mass casualty events with increased efficiency, improved coordination, and ultimately, better outcomes for those in need of urgent medical care.

## üë• Multi-Role Support

RapidCare supports multiple roles to ensure comprehensive emergency response:

- **ADMIN**: System oversight and role management
- **PHYSICIAN**: Medical assessment and treatment decisions
- **NURSE**: Patient monitoring and vital signs
- **PARAMEDIC/EMT**: Field triage and emergency care
- **REUNIFICATION_COORDINATOR**: Family location and patient matching

## üèÜ Prize Alignment

RapidCare is designed to compete for multiple prizes by showcasing different aspects of our architecture:

### **The Jetson Prize**
For the best demonstration of on-device power by deploying a Gemma 3n product on an NVIDIA Jetson device.

**Our Approach**: RapidCare runs fully offline on Jetson devices, processing all critical tasks locally including video analysis, voice transcription, and patient triage. When internet connectivity is lost, data is stored locally and synced when connectivity returns.

### **The Google AI Edge Prize**
For the most compelling and effective use case built using the Google AI Edge implementation of Gemma 3n.

**Our Approach**: We leverage Google Edge AI for optimized inference and device interoperability, ensuring seamless operation across different edge devices while maintaining performance.

### **The Ollama Prize**
For the best project that utilizes and showcases the capabilities of Gemma 3n running locally via Ollama.

**Our Approach**: Our local-first architecture uses Ollama to run Gemma 3n models locally, ensuring zero-latency responses even without internet connectivity.

### **The Unsloth Prize**
For the best fine-tuned Gemma 3n model created using Unsloth, optimized for a specific, impactful task.

**Our Approach**: We fine-tune Gemma 3n specifically for mass casualty incident response, optimizing for medical triage, patient reunification, and emergency coordination tasks.
